</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid or revoked API key (401)">
  Your API key is not valid. This can happen if the key was copied incorrectly or was revoked.

## Connection Issues

<Accordion title="MCP server not starting">
  If Claude Code or Cursor cannot connect to the MCP server, check that uvx is installed, test the server directly with LEEROOPEDIA_API_KEY set, and run claude mcp list to verify connectivity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool requires permission approval">
  In Claude Code non-interactive mode, MCP tools need explicit permission. Use --allowedTools or --dangerously-skip-permissions. In interactive mode, a prompt appears automatically.
