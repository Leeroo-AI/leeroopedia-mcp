---

Build a step-by-step ML execution plan grounded in knowledge base documentation. Returns an overview, key specs, numbered steps, and validation criteria.

## When to Use

- **Starting implementation:** Get the correct sequence of steps before writing code
- **Framework-specific plans:** Plans informed by real documentation, not just general knowledge
- **Validation criteria:** Know what to check to verify your implementation

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `goal` | Yes | string | What you want to accomplish |
| `constraints` | No | string | Constraints or requirements (e.g., hardware limits, time budget) |

## Example

```
Tool: build_plan
Goal: "Implement QLoRA fine-tuning for Llama-3.1-8B on a single A100"
Constraints: "Must fit in 40GB VRAM, target loss < 0.5"
```

**Returns:** Overview, key specs, numbered steps, and validation criteria, all grounded in KB documentation.
