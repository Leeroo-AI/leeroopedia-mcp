title: "propose_hypothesis"
description: "Propose ranked approaches backed by knowledge base evidence"
---

Propose ranked research hypotheses grounded in knowledge base evidence. Returns ranked ideas with rationale and suggested experiments.

## When to Use

- **Design decisions:** Choosing between architectures, strategies, or approaches
- **Alternative approaches:** Get ranked options backed by documented patterns
- **Next steps:** When you're unsure how to proceed

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `current_status` | Yes | string | Where the project stands now |
| `recent_experiments` | No | string | Description of recent experiments and their outcomes |

## Example

```
Tool: propose_hypothesis
Current Status: "Building a RAG pipeline for technical docs. Naive retrieval gives 
                 low recall on multi-hop questions."
Recent Experiments: "Tried increasing chunk overlap to 200 tokens. Marginal improvement."
```

**Returns:** Ranked hypotheses (e.g., try hybrid search, add query expansion, use HyDE) with rationale and suggested next steps.
