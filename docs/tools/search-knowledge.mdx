Search the knowledge base for framework documentation, API references, config formats, and best practices. An AI agent synthesizes a grounded answer with `[PageID]` citations.

## When to Use

- **Before coding** — Understand how a framework or library works before implementing
- **Looking up config formats** — Data structures, expected behavior, API contracts
- **Architecture questions** — Design patterns, conventions, internal workings
- **Verified information** — Get documented facts instead of guessing

<Tip>
Call this tool **multiple times in parallel** with different queries to search from multiple angles at once. This is much faster than sequential searches.
</Tip>

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | Yes | string | What you want to find out |
| `context` | No | string | Optional context about what you're building |

## Example

```
Tool: search_knowledge
Query: "How does device_mapping work in ROLL?"
Context: "I am implementing a distributed RL training setup"
```

**Returns:** A synthesized answer with `[PageID]` citations that can be followed up with [`get_page`](/docs/tools/get-page).
