title: "get_page"
description: "Retrieve a specific knowledge base page by its exact ID"
---

Retrieve the full content of a specific knowledge base page by its exact ID. A direct lookup — no AI agent needed.

## When to Use

- **Follow up on citations** — Other tools return `[PageID]` citations in their responses. Use `get_page` to get the full page.
- **Deeper detail** — When a synthesized answer isn't enough and you need the complete reference
- **Direct access** — Read a specific page you already know the ID of

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `page_id` | Yes | string | Exact page ID to retrieve |

## Example

```
Tool: get_page
Page ID: "Workflow/QLoRA_Finetuning"
```

**Returns:** The full page content formatted as markdown.

## Common Page ID Formats

Page IDs follow a wiki-like structure:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Workflow/` | Step-by-step workflows | `Workflow/QLoRA_Finetuning` |
| `Principle/` | Core concepts and principles | `Principle/LoRA_Rank_Selection` |
| `Heuristic/` | Practical heuristics and rules of thumb | `Heuristic/Huggingface_Alignment_handbook_QLoRA_Learning_Rate_Scaling` |

<Note>
If a page ID is not found, the tool returns an error message. Double-check that you're using the exact ID from the citation.
